This git is about an attack on the extension Canvas Defender on firefox (by multilogin).

To use it, you need to upload everything, you 3 mains files will be fp.js, server.py (if you turn in local), and finger_print.html.
The files php are usefull if you want to create a database, by the way, you need to modify the finger_print.html to don't use the request php, but POST with the server.py.

The last file which has the extension xpi, is the file of Canva defender extension. If you have this extension, you normally have this also on your device (computer here).
